# **Introduction**

`made by @jirachibot, forked from @verysussy (thanks m8)`

`supports Pokétwo with the help of Poké-Name`

## Disclaimer:
- Self-botting is against Pokétwo and even Discord's TOS
- If you get banned for using this bot, it is not my responsibility
- It is recommended to use you alt rather than your main as the bot

## Sup, this is a discord selfbot that responds to the Pokename bot's pings
You will need to enter some values in config.json, (make sure these are private!) They are:

**Token**: your bot's token (google how to get it)

**Prefix**: any prefix (example: "!")

**ownerID**: *YOUR* ID, or ID of whoever is controlling the bot

**botID**: bot's ID

**logID**: channel where your bot announces if it catches it's shiny hunt (preferably in a private channel)

**Hunt**: whatever you are hunting (example: ralts)


after entering your values, it should look something like this: https://imgur.com/a/aWqwJ40

## Features:

- Command that shows your current streak
- Responds to Poké-Name's Shiny Hunt Ping
- Responds to Poké-Name's Collection Ping
- logs when you catch your hunt
- logs when you catch a shiny pokemon and sends a (kinda) realistic response when it catches a shiny pokemon, like "nice"
- No need to complete any CAPTCHAs

## Command(s):

- **sh**: shows the bot's current shinyhunt streak (use in a private server)
- **say**: says whatever you want the bot to say

## Setup:

- Paste this code in VSCode or any alternative
- Fill in the config.json (mentioned above)
- If you get any errors, try typing `npm i discord.js-selfbot` or `npm i discord.js-selfbot-v13` in the terminal 
- Join many servers (not too many at the same time duh) and let the bot do it's work!

`Happy Catching!`
